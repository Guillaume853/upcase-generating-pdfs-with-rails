# Invoicer

This is the companion codebase to [The Weekly Iteration, Episode 105:
Generating PDFs with Rails][].

In this episode, we walk through everything we need to work with PDFs in our
Rails apps: the easiest way to generate them, how to properly serve them as
responses in our controllers, and even how to test them.

Invoicer is a simple application that will generate PDF receipts.
